# ng-c3-export

In this repository you can find a module extending c3 chart library with image exporting functionality.

## Demo
You can check a working demo [here](https://ngc3export.firebaseapp.com/).

## Install

Install via npm: 

```
npm install ng-c3-export
```

Install via bower: 

```
bower install ng-c3-export
```

## Usage

### 0. step

First include the library files `ng-c3-export.js` and `ng-c3-export.css` (or the minified version of them). 

> If you use a tool like e.g. **wiredep** that wires your bower dependencies, you don't have to worry about this step.
> It will find them because they are configured in the bower.json file.

### 1. step 

Add **ngC3Export** module to your angular module as dependency:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('c3ExportTest', [
  'ngC3Export'
]);
```

### 2. step

Put the export-chart directive on the element you use for your c3 chart:

```html
<div id="my-line-chart" export-chart exported-file-name="My line chart exported"></div>
```

And you're ready to go! Now you should be able to see a grey download icon on your chart in the top right corner.
